# Task Manager

This mini-project is a Relational Database Management System built using Flask, SQLAlchemy ORM, and a frontend framework Materialize.

The app allows to perform full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionality on a database of tasks. All functionality is available through an HTML-based user interface. To provide a more user-friendly experience, the interface is styled using the Materialize which is a modern responsive front-end framework based off of Google's Material Design concept.


## Features
### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is displayed at the top of the page. It includes a logo with the name of the app and link to the home page. The navigation bar also includes a button to add a new task and a button to open a modal window with a list of categories.

### Main Content
- #### Add a Task
The home page displays a button to add a task. When the button is clicked, the window is expanded and a form to add a task is displayed. The form includes fields for the task name, task description, due date, if the task is urgent, and the task category. The form also includes a button to add the task to the database if all fields are filled out.

- #### Tasks
The List of Tasks is a list of collapsible elements. Each element represents a task storaged in the database. Once the task is clicked, the task details is expanded and displayed. The summary info of the task contains the task name, due date, whether the task is urgent. The task details include the task category, description and buttons to edit or delete the task.

### Categories
The List of Categories contains a button to add a new category and a list of all categories in the database. Each card of the category list contains the category name and two buttons to edit or delete the category from database. If the category is deleted, all tasks associated with the category are also deleted.

### Form elements
To provide a more user-friendly experience, the app contains vairous form elements, such as:
[switches](https://materializecss.com/switches.html), [datepickers](https://materializecss.com/pickers.html), [selectors](https://materializecss.com/select.html), and the [standard input boxes](https://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html).

## Project Setup
- ### Virtual Environment
#### Set Up Virtualenv with Virtualenvwrapper on Ubuntu 22.04
To isolate the project from the rest of the system, I used a virtual environment.
1. Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper using pip:
    ```
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
    ```
2. Add the directory where virtualenv was installed <~/.local/bin> to your system's PATH
    ```
    $ nano .bashrc
    <export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH">
    ```
    **or**
    ```
    echo "export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    Any executables installed in <~/.local/bin> will be available to you from anywhere in your shell.
3. Finally edit <.bashrc> or <.bash_profile> or both:
    ```
    $ nano .bashrc
    <export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs>
    <export PROJECT_HOME=~/repos> # or wherever you keep your projects
    <export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=~/.local/bin/virtualenv>
    <source ~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh>
    ```
4. Reload the shell:
    ```
    $ source .bashrc
    ```
5. **Create a virtual environment** (flag `-a` means to associate the virtual       environment with a project):
    ```
    $ cd <path to project>
    $ mkvirtualenv -a <path to project> <name of virtual environment>
    ```
6. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```
    $ workon <name of virtual environment>
    ```

- ### Python Packages: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2
- To install the required packages, run the following command:
    By installing Flask-SQLAlchemy, this actually comes with both Flask and the SQLAlchemy requirements together in one download.
    ```
    pip install 'Flask-SQLAlchemy<3' psycopg2 sqlalchemy==1.4.46
    ```
**OR**

- Add the following lines to the `<requirements.txt>` file:
    ```
    Flask==2.2.3
    Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
    psycopg2==2.9.6
    SQLAlchemy==1.4.46
    ```
    and run the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- ### App Configuration
1. Create environment variable for sensitive information and add it to the `<.gitignore>` file:
    ```
    $ touch env.py .gitignore
    $ echo env.py >> .gitignore
    ```
2. Set the environment variables in the `<env.py>` file:
    See the `example_env.py` file.
3. Make imports and set the configuration in the `__init__.py` file of the main Flask app package.
4. Create database (_PostgreSQL 14/Ubuntu 22.04_):
    - Start running the PostgreSQL server:
        ```
        $ sudo service postgresql start
        ```
    - Log in to the PostgreSQL server as the default user:
        _This command connect you to the `postgres` database as the `postgres` user_
        ```
        $ sudo -u postgres psql
        ```
        If you want to connect to a different database, or as a different user, you can use the following command:
        ```
        $ psql -d <database name> -U <user name>
        ```
        **or**
        ```
        $ psql <database name>
        ```
    - Create a new database:
        ```
        # CREATE DATABASE <database name>;
        ```
    - Switch to the new database:
        ```
        # \c <database name>
        ```
    - Check the dt table in the database:
        ```
        # psql <database name>
        # \dt
        ```
    - Create tables using the SQLAlchemy ORM in the `models.py` file

5. Local Migration

    - Initial setup

    _This method only for initial setup, it creates all the necessary tables in your database as defined by your SQLAlchemy models_
        ```
        $ python
        >>> from taskmanager import db
        >>> db.create_all()
        >>> exit()
        ```
    - **To make changes to the database, you need [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension:**

        ```
        $ pip install Flask-Migrate
        ```
    - Add the following lines to the `<__init__.py>` file of the main Flask app package:
        ```
        from flask_migrate import Migrate

        migrate = Migrate(app, db)
        ```

    - Create a migration repository

    _Run only once to initialize a new Alembic environment and create the required folder structure for managing database schema migrations_
        ```
        $ flask db init
        ```
    - Generate an initial migration:
        ```
        $ flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
        ```
    - Apply the migration (changes described by the migration script) to the database:
        ```
        $ flask db upgrade
        ```
    **Note**: _Each time you make changes to the models, you need to run the migrate and upgrade commands to update the database_

    - To downgrade the database to the previous migration, you need to run the downgrade command:
        ```
        $ flask db upgrade
        ```

6. Remote Migration
    https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-2-postgres-sqlalchemy-and-alembic/#remote-migration

- ### jQuery
Add jQuery script using the CDN (Content Delivery Network) version of the framework.

Note: _jQuery library must be loaded before the Materialize `<script>` tag_
```
<!-- jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.4.js" integrity="sha256-a9jBBRygX1Bh5lt8GZjXDzyOB+bWve9EiO7tROUtj/E="crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

- ### Materialize and Material Design Icons
The easiest way to work with [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) is to use the CDN (Content Delivery Network) version of the framework. To do this, add the following line to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
```

<!-- Material Design Icons courtesy of Google -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css">
```
Then, add the following line to the end of the `<body>` section of your HTML file:
```
 <!-- Compiled and minified JavaScript -->
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script>
```
